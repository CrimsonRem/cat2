<h1> Our Goals</h1>

<p>
Our goals in forming this organization is to in short improve the quality of the lives of Nairobian citizens. With all the issues in mind such as the poverty and lack of government funding, these people are forced into a horrible way of life which many kind hearts have been able to help with. Organizations like ours have helped give these people schools, clothing and more which would not be given to them at all if it werenâ€™t for them. We hope to do the same and provide these people with something that can help them to have more convenient, happy, and healthier lives.

    <li>Giving To Nairobi is a non-profit organization</li>
    <li>We started this organization because of an experience a fellow founder had while he was on a trip to Kenya.</li>
    <li> After seeing how poorly the slums and living environments were in Kenya, he was motivated to try and change the way Kenyans live for the better.</li>
