    <p>There will be many ways we can help Nairobi and Kenya as a whole. We will try to provide many uses of technologies that we have here and we will try to make everything more efficient. Our website will be able to help us spread word of the situation for Kenyans and to be able to raise money to provide for them as well.
            A majority of the donation money will go into the technology which will help Kenyans with their food and water supply.
            The rest will be used to provide to these people in other ways as well.
            With social media, we can maximize our exposure to the world for more people to come and contact us for a great cause.
             Here are a bunch of things we will try to do...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access to clean water</li>
    <li>Better access to water and food</li>
    <li>Place down solar powered water pumps and solar farms.</li>
    <li>Increased access to education</li>
    <li>Try to provide education with technology</li>
    <li>Better waste management</li>
    <li>Better access to energy</li>
</ul>
